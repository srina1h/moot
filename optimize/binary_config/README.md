# Details

All of these models were obtained or generated with the same 3 goals:

* Reduce Costs
* Reduce Number of Defects
* Increase the number of sucessfully previously implemented features/measures

These models have been obtained from [iSNEAK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19125)

### Billing

Billing is a dataset of 10 thousand possible configurations from a software product line describing a billing software. All of the 10 thousand configurations listed here are valid according to the original model's cross-tree constraints. 



### Scrum (1k | 10k | 100k )

These three datasets are respectively 1000, 10000 and 100000 possible configurations of the scrum feature model. All of the configurations are valid according to the original model's cross-tree constraints.

### FFM | FM

These models are generated Feature Models through a tool obtained from the [SPLOT](https://www.splot-research.org/) research website.

The numbers in the names of the dataset represent respectively
* Number of variables
* Number of constraints
* Clause/Constraint ratio
