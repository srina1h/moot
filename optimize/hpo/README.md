### Health
The Health data sets show results where random forest
regression algorithms were configured to predict for number of (a) commits or
(b) closed issues or (c) close pull requests in 12 months time in open source
projects housed at GitHub. The Y values of these data sets show the results
of the predictions after certain hyperparameters were applied to the random
forests (which, in turn, were applied to the GitHub data).
