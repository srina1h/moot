### A2C\_Acrobot

This dataset contains data generated by optimizing the hyperparameters of the A2C algorithm on the Acrobot environment. The columns represent various metrics and hyperparameters:

*   **EvalMeanReturn+**: Mean evaluation return (higher is better).
*   **EvalVarReturn-**: Variance in evaluation return (lower is better).
*   **ConvergenceTime-**: Time taken to converge (lower is better).
*   **ScoreX**: Performance score.
*   **gamma**: Discount factor for future rewards.
*   **Learning\_rate**: Learning rate for the algorithm.
*   **n\_steps**: Number of steps for updates.
*   **Ent\_coef**: Entropy coefficient for exploration.
*   **Vf\_coef**: Value function coefficient for loss calculation.
*   **Max\_grad\_norm**: Maximum gradient norm.
*   **Gae\_lambda**: Lambda for generalized advantage estimation.
*   **NumLayers**: Number of layers in the neural network.
*   **Layer1Nodes**: Number of nodes in the first layer.
*   **Layer2Nodes**: Number of nodes in the second layer.
