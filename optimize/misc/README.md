# Details

These two datasets are not connected with software engineering tasks, instead they optimize for a car performance in the case of auto93 and the quality of a wine in Wine Quality. They serve as debug purposes. While all other datasets require some specialized SE domain knowledge. These two allow SE newcomers to apply their general knowledge while implementing and fixing their algorithms.
