# MNIST Dataset in CSV Format

The MNIST dataset provided in an easy-to-use CSV format. The original dataset is in a format that is difficult for beginners to use. This dataset uses the work of Joseph Redmon to provide the MNIST dataset in a CSV format.

The `mnist_1.csv` contains 10,000 test examples and labels. Each row consists of 785 values: the first value is the label (a number from 0 to 9) and the remaining 784 values are the pixel values (a number from 0 to 255).

This CSV format makes it easy to load and process the data using common data analysis libraries like pandas, making it particularly accessible for beginners and educational purposes.

# ImageNet 8 Small Dataset

The ImageNet 8 Small dataset is also provided in a convenient CSV format for easy use in machine learning projects.

The `imagenet8_small.csv` contains 60,000 samples. Each row consists of 193 values: the last value is the label (y value) and the preceding 192 values are the feature values (x values).

Similar to the MNIST format, this structure allows for straightforward data loading and processing using common data analysis libraries, making it ideal for both educational purposes and practical machine learning applications.
