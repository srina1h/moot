### COC1000

COC is a predecessor model to XOMO containing many of the same variables it represents a COCOMO-like software process where the goals are to:

* Reduce risk;
* Reduce Effort
* Reduce analyst experience
* Reduce programming language experience



### nasa93dem

nasa93dem is another example of a COCOMO-like software process model representing data from real projects from the USC Cocomo style models.

### POM3 (A-D)

The POM3 model is a tool for exploring the management challenge of agile development balancing idlerates,completion rates and overall cost. More specifically:
 * In the agile world, projects terminate after achieving a completion rate of X% (X<100) of its required tasks; 
 * Team members become idle if forced to wait for a yet-to-be finished task from other teams; 
 * To lower the idle rate and improve the completion rate, management can hire staff, but this increases the overall cost.

The POM3 model simulates the Boehm and Turner model of agile programming. For the four models present here they increase in complexity where D is more complex than C which in turn is more complex than B and B is more complex than A.



### XOMO (Flight, Ground, OSP and OSP2)

XOMO introduced by Dr. Tim Menzies, is a general framework for Monte Carlo simulations that combines four COCOMO-like software process models from Boehm's group at the University of Southern California. The overall goals for XOMO are to:
 * Reduce risk;
 * Reduce effort;
 * Reduce defects;
 * Reduce months.

The available XOMO models here all come from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Where Flight and Ground are general descriptions of  all JPL's flight and ground software. While OSP and OSP2 are two versions of the flight guidance system of the Orbital Space Plane. In terms of complexity we know that OSP and OSP2 are similar, with Ground being a bit more complex and finally Flight being the most complex of all.
