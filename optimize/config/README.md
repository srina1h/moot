# Details

### SS-Models

All of the models with this nomenclature come from the software configuration literature. The data here was collected via running software configured in different ways (selected at random) then collecting various performance statistics (runtimes, query times, usage, etc.). The goal of these datasets is to find the software configuration that best reduces the overall software goals of each specific project.


### Apache | HSMGP | SQL | X264 

These datasets are similar to the SS-Models, the only difference is that instead of being related to random non-descript software configurations they are linked to specific pieces of software. Specifically Apache configurations, HSMGP configurations, SQL configurations and configurations to the X264 encoding software.

### RS | SOL | WC 

These datasets are also SS-Datasets.
